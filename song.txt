I've seen the world,
Done it all, had my cake now.
Diamonds, brilliant, and Bel-Air now.
Hot summer nights mid July,
When you and I were forever wild.
The crazy days, the city lights
The way you'd play with me like a child.


Will you still love me
When I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me

Ну как вам наша песня?
